# Getting started

Once you got the repository, you can check out the examples by executing them in order. First run the processing code, which will produce the processed data. Then run the analysis scripts, which will take the processed data and produce some results. Then you can run the manuscript, poster and slides example files in any order. Those files pull in the generated results and display them. These files also pull in references from the `bibtex` file and format them according to the CSL style.
