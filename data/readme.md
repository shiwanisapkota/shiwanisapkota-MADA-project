This `data` folder contains the raw and processed files.

raw_data: NHIS provides .xml and .dat file while extracting the data from website so I converted that file provided by NHIS into rds and csv files. The created csv file was very large (153 MB) and GitKraken didn't like it so only rds file has been added to the raw_data folder.

processed_cleaned_data: This folder contains the cleaned rds and csv file created after processing the data as I wanted and the codes used during cleaning process has been provided along with the project.
