<p>There are many data in NHIS. Looks like you didn’t put the link in one obvious place. If people miss your data link. New user who are not familiar with your major may need to try hard to find you data. Good thing is you describe it well. So professional people may easy to follow you.</p>

<p>data_cleaning.Rmd not work well in my computer. Neither exploratory_analysis.Rmd. In html file, I think there should be some summary way you can show your data. Not a long table. Or maybe you can pick few table which you think important and hide others.</p>

<section id="feedback-and-comments-4" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="feedback-and-comments-4">Feedback and Comments</h3>
<p>Some code error in my computer to run the code.</p>
<p>Some of data wrangling is included in model_fitting code. I think you can move them to wrangling part to make your modeling more clear.</p>
<p>Some of data wrangling is included in model_evaluation code. At model_evaluation part. You only tried full model and one ‘ALTERNATIVE MODEL’ describing few statistical reason. As you tried in logistic regression. There are some large p-value like ‘year2005’ with 4.88e- 1, ’year2010’with 1.41e- 4. Why not tried forward or backward model selection to pick a optimal model. Also, if I make to this step. I will try ANOVA analysis, to have look at a F-test. Since there are some categorical variables which including multiple strata. T-test may not be enough. About table 3, Model Performance Comparisons. I think you can try adjusted multivariable logistic regression. Since in real world, we don’t have to limit our variables number to 2 or 3. Logistic regression can have an optimal model given the dataset, the alpha threshold and the direction of model selection method.</p>
<p>Some of data wrangling is included in machine_leaning. ROC_AUC result were transfer manually which is a not safe way. I have met some datasets which are tricky. When I come back and double check the data wrangling, manual result transfer make me generate error even I think I am a careful person. Use code to transfer your ROC_AUC result is better.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="feedback-and-comments-5">Feedback and Comments</h3>
<p>Table 1 and figure 1 are good. Table is well looked. But I think ANOVA table is needed. Since like ‘year’, there are multiple strata. T-test may not enough. Table 3 looks good. But I think backward and forward comparison may be better to put here rather than the current one. If we don’t have specific reason why we have to limit the number of variables to 2 or 3. Figure 3 is well looked. But I think there should be several better model than current alternative model.(like backward selection model) Since this alternative model were chosen manually without showing statistic reason.</p>

<p>Very good background description and discussion. It will be better if try further modeling. Like comparison between using optimal logistic regression AUC and null model. Or compare backward and forward model selection. I think these can be next steps of your table 3.</p>
