	abstract = {Background-Regular screening tests can lead to early detection of breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers, when treatment is likely to be more effective. This study examines and compares sociodemographic, health status, and health behavior patterns of screening for breast cancer, cervical cancer, and colorectal cancer among women aged 45 and over in the United States. Methods-This study is based on data from the 2015 and 2018 National Health Interview Surveys. Women were considered to have received colorectal cancer screening if they reported having one of the following: a) report of a home fecal occult blood test (FOBT) in the past year, b) sigmoidoscopy procedure in the past 5 years with FOBT in the past 3 years, or c) colonoscopy in the past 10 years. Women were considered to have received breast cancer screening if they had a mammogram within the past 2 years. Women were considered to have received cervical cancer screening if they reported having a Pap smear in the past 3 years. Cancer screening was analyzed by sociodemographic, health status, health behavior, and health care use characteristics. Results-Among women aged 45 and over, higher percentages of screening were associated with higher socioeconomic status, being married or living with a partner, and healthy behaviors such as not smoking, participating in physical activity, and receiving a flu shot. Conclusion-Differences in screening identified in this study are generally consistent with previous studies on screening for colorectal, breast, and cervical cancers for women at average risk and within the age groups recommended for screening. The results of this study support other findings showing the persistence of disparities in cancer screening among women aged 45 and over according to most of the selected characteristics regardless of recommended age of screening.},

	issn = {0098-7484},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of screening mammography by age, number of mammographic views per screen, screening interval, and duration of follow-up.
DESIGN: Literature review and meta-analysis. DATA IDENTIFICATION AND ANALYSIS: Literature search of English-language studies reported from January 1966 to October 31, 1993, using MEDLINE, manual literature review, and consultation with experts. A total of 13 studies were selected, and their results were combined using meta-analytic techniques based on the assumption of fixed effects.
MAIN RESULTS: The overall summary relative risk (RR) estimate for breast cancer mortality for women aged 50 to 74 years undergoing screening mammography compared with those who did not was 0.74 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.66 to 0.83). The magnitude of the benefit in this age group was similar regardless of number of mammographic views per screen, screening interval, or duration of follow-up. In contrast, none of the summary RR estimates for women aged 40 to 49 years was significantly less than 1.0, irrespective of screening intervention or duration of follow-up. The overall summary RR estimate in women aged 40 to 49 years was 0.93 (95\% CI, 0.76 to 1.13); the summary RR estimate for those studies that used two-view mammography was 0.87 (95\% CI, 0.68 to 1.12) compared with 1.02 (95\% CI, 0.73 to 1.44) for those studies that used one-view mammography, and for those studies with 7 to 9 years of follow-up, the summary RR estimate was 1.02 (95\% CI, 0.82 to 1.27) compared with 0.83 (95\% CI, 0.65 to 1.06) for those studies with 10 to 12 years of follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Screening mammography significantly reduces breast cancer mortality in women aged 50 to 74 years after 7 to 9 years of follow-up, regardless of screening interval or number of mammographic views per screen. There is no reduction in breast cancer mortality in women aged 40 to 49 years after 7 to 9 years of follow-up. Screening mammography may be effective in reducing breast cancer mortality in women aged 40 to 49 years after 10 to 12 years of follow-up, but the same benefit could probably be achieved by beginning screening at menopause or 50 years of age.},

	abstract = {Results from the randomized trial conducted by the Health Insurance Plan (HIP) to determine the efficacy of breast cancer screening with mammography and palpation are reported for longer periods than previously available. By the end of 10 years after entry, the study group's mortality due to breast cancer was about 30\% below the control group's. Arithmetic gains due to screening were maintained through year 14; relative gains declined. With increases in the period of follow-up, cumulative survival rates among cases detected by mammography alone (palpation negative during screening), decreased more rapidly than rates among other subgroups, but survival rates for mammography cases remained relatively high. Study women aged 40-49 years at entry began to show lower breast cancer mortality than those in the control group as duration of follow-up increased. Reservations are advanced about the acceptance of this finding as evidence of the efficacy of screening under age 50 under the conditions of the HIP study. The reservations are based on the observation that the decrease of mortality among the study group aged 45-49 at entry is concentrated entirely among cases diagnosed after they reached 50 years of age.},

METHODS: Using logistic regression models, we analyzed data from the 1998 National Health Interview Survey to assess the relative importance of the independent variables in predicting use of cancer screening services.
RESULTS: Having a usual source of care was the most important predictor of cancer screening use for all race/ethnicity groups. Health insurance was associated with an increased likelihood of cancer screening. Smoking was associated with a decreased likelihood of cancer screening.
CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of race/ethnicity, most women follow mammography and cervical cancer screening guidelines. The identification of specific factors associated with adherence to cancer screening guidelines may help inform screening campaigns.},
